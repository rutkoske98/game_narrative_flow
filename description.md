## Description
Anna's Adventure is a choice based game with a story. This game could function as the grounds for a point-and-click interactive video game, akin to old games by HIT Entertainment. Anna is a young gilr who is searching her house for her lost teddy bear, but there are playful imps hiding in every room. Anna must search an array of six rooms to recover her bear. The user is prompted to choose between two rooms, a total of three times. When a room is chosen, small ASCII art of the room layout is shown. Users then have the choice to search the room chosen, or continue to the next. The lose scenario says: "You couldn't find your teddy bear. Maybe next time!" The win scenario says: "Congratulations! You found your teddy bear!"
