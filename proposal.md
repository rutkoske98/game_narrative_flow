# Title
Game Narrative Flow

## Repository
https://github.com/rutkoske98/game_narrative_flow.git

## Description
This code will be a starting point for a choose-your-own-adventure story in an interactive cinematic video game. It will feature a plethora of choices and will output certain messages after specific dialogue and action decisions are made by the user, ending with a unique story conclusion.

## Features
- Feature 1
	- Questions will prompt the user for input
- Feature 2
	- The code will then react and tell the story until the next user input, etc.
- Feature N 
	- A list of story options and results will need to be created, and the code must call different story beats at the proper time.

## Challenges
- I will need to review how calling objects in lists and making lists works, as well as creating a story that the user will be interested in.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The story will flow seamlessly influenced only by the histroy of player choices, and conlcuding.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Creating a list of narrative points is essential, as well as a list of questions that will lead to the next.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Draft the story
  2. Type in all story points

- Week 2
  1. Implement narrative questions
  2. Make a working list that can be referenced

- Week N (Final)
  1. Finish first draft
  2. Refine parts of code that are not working and finalize the code.
